The Long Weary Slog to HTTPS

I want to turn my site from an HTTP one to an HTTPS one. The easiest way, I’ve heard to do this, is to set up a load balancer to do the task. Not that my own site warrants even a single CPU, but it beats managing your own cert on your web server. 
Digital Ocean – set up and maintain your own cert, please. I can’t with that. Google can create and manage the certs for you, for now anyway (Still in beta)  https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/ssl-certificates
“To use HTTPS or SSL load balancing, you must associate at least one SSL certificate with the load balancer's target proxy. You can configure the target proxy with up to ten SSL certificates.”
Target proxy? Confused puppy look. 
Anyway, the documentation jumped ahead of us. So I need to set up a load balancer https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/choosing-load-balancer , presumably a HTTP(S) one https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/https/setting-up-https . More mandatory instruction https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/https/ : Google sure is wordy. 
Anyway, I specifically want HTTPS Load Balancer, in which “the client SSL session terminates at the load balancer.” https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/https/ 

Enough! I want to set up a load balancer https://cloud.google.com/iap/docs/load-balancer-howto#firewalls . Wait, I need to get a certificate first. 
The problem with Google Documentation is that it always assumes you’ve read all the other Google documentation first, no matter where you actually start.
Managed certificate, please. https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/ssl-certificates#managed-certs

From the GCloud command line: 
gcloud beta compute ssl-certificates create [SSL_CERTIFICATE_NAME] \
        --domains [DOMAIN]

I just made up a cert name and assigned it to my own domain name joabj.info. 
To see all your certs, run this in the GCloud command line:
gcloud beta compute ssl-certificates list

It is going to show it as provisional until the following conditions are met: 

We do a content-based load balancer
https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/https/content-based-example
“For the certificate provisioning process to proceed, all of the following conditions must be met:
•	The DNS records for your domain must reference the IP address of your load balancer's target proxy,
•	Your target proxy must reference the Google-managed certificate resource.
•	Your load balancer configuration must be complete, including the creation of a forwarding rule.”

So wait—the first thing the load balancer doc tells ne is that I need 
a SSL cert, but then the ssl cert provisioning tool tells me I need a load balancer. Wut?
Also, wait DigitalOcean can do HTTPS termination too: 
https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/networking/load-balancers/how-to/ssl-termination/\



OK, so starting the configuration :

https://console.cloud.google.com/net-services/loadbalancing/http/add

So I clicked on create a new load balancer. give it a name. Fine, then...

Click Backend configuration, then create or select a backend service. If you create a new backend service, follow the steps below:

    Add a Name for your backend service.
    Under Protocol, select HTTP or HTTPS. For HTTPS, each instance must be configured to serve SSL and have a certificate installed. However, you can use any certificate, including a self-signed one.
    In Backends > New Backend > Instance group, select the instance group you want to use.
    
    
So now I got to go back and create an instance group of my VM. Sheesh. OK, so jump over to this page:
https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instance-groups/

"A managed instance group uses an instance template to create a group of 
identical instances. You control a managed instance group as a single entity. 
If you wanted to make changes to instances that are part of a managed instance group, 
you would make the change to the whole instance group."


"By default, instances in the group will be placed in the default 
network and randomly assigned IP addresses from the regional range."

Oh, then there is this:

"Unmanaged instance groups are groups of dissimilar instances that you 
can arbitrarily add and remove from the group. Unmanaged instance groups 
do not offer autoscaling, rolling update support, or the use of instance 
templates so Google recommends creating managed instance groups whenever possible. 
Use unmanaged instance groups only if you need to apply load balancing to your 
pre-existing configurations or to groups of dissimilar instances."

This is actually what I need, since I'm only using one instance. Autoscaling will
have to wait for another day, I'm afraid.


So, here is another page to read: https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instance-groups/creating-groups-of-unmanaged-instances

Off we go to the "create Instance Groups" page, https://console.cloud.google.com/compute/instanceGroups/
Select "UNmanaged Instance Group" then hit ENTER a bunch of times for defaults.
